# Test Plan for `[Project Name]`
```[Notes formatted like these should be removed or changed. If you remove the whole section please follow the numeration properly]```
#### Document Purpose
```[Describe why this document is being written, who is the target reader of this document and finally what purpose follows this document]```

## 1. Test Objective
### 1.1. Product under test
```[This section should describe the application under test. At least give the generic idea, and links to its specifications]```

### 1.2. Testing scope
```[A list of features/areas which is going to be tested]```
- __Feature 1__
- __Feature 2__
### 1.3. Out of scope
```[Definition of areas and functionalities that is not going to be tested, these also should identify why these areas are out of testing scope]```
- __Area 1__: Reason
- __Area 2__: Reason

## 2. Testing Strategy
### 2.1. Test Types Definitions
```[This section is used when you need to explain the details of testing to people who are far from testing processes. Use it if your customer isn't aware of testing in detail otherwise remove this section. The section describes which testing types are going to be used for testing the product, testing targets, and beliefs for each testing type. Further types used as an example and should be adjusted/extended to the realities]```

#### Feature testing - *Level: System*
```[This testing is used when it’s expected to check and ensure whether product features are implementing business logic. This covers all feature sides, like positive and negative outcomes and side effects.]```

#### Product regression testing - *Level: Acceptance*
```[Executed when it’s expected to check and ensure whether new product features does not affect existing business logic]```

### 2.2. Test Approach
```[This is a very important section. Here you should define how the testing process is being performed. It should explain where is the beginning and what follows after that, and what outcomes could be expected after processes are done. I'm leaving this abstract so you clearly understand how to describe it and it differs from project to project]```

### 2.3. Execution process
```[Here should be defined how testing execution is going to be logically performed, meaning is it a bunch of tests or it's a single fluid 'endless' process]```
#### 2.3.1. ```[Entrance/Resumption]``` criteria
```[A list of criteria which determines an entrance/resuming of the testing process, after which it means that build or env is under testing now]```
- Criteria 1
- Criteria 2

#### 2.3.2. ```[Exit/Suspension]``` criteria
```[A list of criteria which determines an exit/suspend of the testing process, after which it means that build or env is not under test anymore]```
- Criteria 1
- Criteria 2

## 3. Management
### 3.1. Deliverables
```[Determine a list of items and stages that becomes an outcome as a result of those stages. Here should be test plans, test suites, reports, etc.]```
- __Item__ | Stage - some definition or comment

### 3.2. Software Risk Issues
```[Determine the critical/risky areas which may increase any testing resource or produce any testing outage]```

### 3.3. Project schedule
```[Determine when should be following each planned activity, it can be dateless onprocess depended list as well]```

### 3.4. Used tools
```[Define what tools are going to be used to satisfy testing processes]```

### 3.5. Environmental Needs
```[Define which hardware/3rd party is needed to fulfill the requirements. Meaning where the product is going to be tested]```

### 3.6. Engineers
#### 3.6.1 Roles and responsibilities
```[Determine who is doing what, who is responsible for providing some objects or doing activities]```

#### 3.6.2 Required staffing and training
```[Define here if needed]```
